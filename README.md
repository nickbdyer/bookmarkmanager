Week 4 at Makers Academy

###The Problem

Task: Create a Bookmark Manager

A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by
tags. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to
the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users
have added.

The website will have the following functionality:

Show a list of links from the database
Add new links
Add tags to the links
Filter links by a tag

###Running the Program

```sh
$ rackup
```
Navigate to [localhost](http://localhost:9292/).

###Running the Test Suite

Unit and Acceptance Testing

```sh
$ rspec
```

###Images

The tutorial guided me on my first baby steps into CSS, it isn't much to look
at, but I was more concerned about learning the complicated database and
security topics.

###Lessons Learned

This tutorial project introduced 3 major concepts:
- Acceptance Testing using Capybara
- Relational databases using Postgresql
- Security Considerations


###Improvements

Given the array of new topics covered in this project I am actually quite
pleased with it, despite the poor CSS. 

I would, however, like to try and increase the testing quality and reduce the
size of my controllers.
